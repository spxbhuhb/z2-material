Material 3 components for Kotlin/JS. Check [Material Design](https://m3.material.io) for details on Material.

Status: **initial development**

**WARNING** This project is shared with the community, but our goal is not to produce and support 
a public library, nor to cover Material 3 in its entirety. We add things as needed and change things
if we feel they should be changed.

Check [main.kt](src/jsMain/kotlin/main.kt) for examples.
